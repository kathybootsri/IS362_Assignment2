    "When I began learning about looping in Python, it was initially very difficult to understand because I was use to doing tasks through SQL, which frequently is a query to return results, insert data into a database or perform other database-specific tasks one time, not repeatedly, and especially not repeating based on another list of factors. The concept of repeating the same tasks to work more efficiently was appealing, but it was initially hard to wrap my head around, probably because I tried to tackle the concept of looping before truly grasping what can be iterated (what can be used as a sequence to repeat the loop). Putting two and two together was a disconnect for me, for example, learning about tuples and lists. I did not then further apply that knowledge to know how to truly grasp types that can be iterated. So let's begin with some essential common mistakes and overlooked concepts in the context of loops."
